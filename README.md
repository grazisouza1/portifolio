# Portifolio ðŸ’»
This repository is a portifolio to show some of my projects, besides some courses, certidicates and a little bit more information about me. You can acces the website <a href="https://grazisouza1.github.io/portifolio/" target="_blank">here</a>. I build this project because it's really important for people to know about my work before contact me for any job.

  ## How did I build that
  &nbsp; The firts thing i did, was a Figma project, trying to imagine how it would look like. The final project didn't go exactly as planned in Figma ðŸ˜…, but somethings had to be change. This is the project I planned: <br>

  <br>
  &nbsp; I initially built a PC project, but I choose to follow the model "Mobile Firts" when I started to build the project on VSCode. For check the responsiveness, I used a [Mobile Simulator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mobile-simulator-responsi/ckejmhbmlajgoklhgbapkiccekfoccmk?hl=pt-BR). This helped me a lot by showing diferent screens and proportions. 

  ## The problems I had
  ### DevTools elements
  &nbsp; One of the problems I had was the HTML file organization. It needs to have the right hierarchy to work, otherwise the project does not work as planned. Sometimes I had difficulties, cause I coudn't really see what I was doing wrong and which element was the problem. <br>
  &nbsp; I could <ins>solve this problem</ins> by using the DevTools from the browser. It helped me to understand wich element was the cause of the problem, and which element was in the wrong place or hierarchy. It was reaaly helpful and I could fix a lot of problems. <br>

<br>

  ### Image paths
&nbsp; Another problem I could solve was the path for importing images. I could learn about how the site can be affected by only having an image with the wrong file path <br>

<br>
&nbsp; In the image, I had this problem with the hello hand image from the hero element. This happened because I was using the wrong path to indicate the image place

## The website structure
### Hero/Main Page

  &nbsp; The section shows some projects I did for syntax learning. They are simple projects, but I vould learn the basics of JavaScript, and understand some types of ligical thinking in that language <br>

  <br>

### Certificates section
&nbsp; The certificates section is about some courses I did. I've sorted it with a filter that separates the courses by institution. It has some Curso em VÃ­deo courses and some from FreeCodeCamp. It was the first time Itried to do a filter like that. I really liked the results an I guess I'mma use this knowledge a lot in the future. <br>
