# Portifolio ðŸ’»
This repository is a portifolio to show some of my projects, besides some courses, certidicates and a little bit more information about me. You can acces the website <a href="https://grazisouza1.github.io/portifolio/" target="_blank">here</a>. I build this project because it's really important for people to know about my work before contact me for any job.

  &nbsp; I initially built a PC project, but I choose to follow the model "Mobile Firts" when I started to build the project on VSCode. For check the responsiveness, I used a [Mobile Simulator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mobile-simulator-responsi/ckejmhbmlajgoklhgbapkiccekfoccmk?hl=pt-BR)
